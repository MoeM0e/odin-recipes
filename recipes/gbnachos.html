        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple, no effort nacho recipe that still feels like a you're hosting a fiesta for dinner. Don't forget the Modelo or Jarritos! Also, we're being super lazy since we're not even baking this. Trust me, easier to serve and it allows for better leftovers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bag of tortilla chips. Don't mess with Tostitos, that stuff is pricy. Get the stuff for $2.50 or less</li>
            <li>1lb of ground beef</li>
            <li>A cheap, store brand package of taco seasoning mix, (or make your own! Taco seasoning mix is easy to make, so look around for one you like!)</li>
            <li>A can of nacho cheese, (again, find the cheap stuff, it's usually better)</li>
            <li>Mozzerella and cheddar, (I don't know the difference between the types of cheddar, so whatever you prefer)</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Pickled jalapenos (optional)</li>
            <li>Pico de gallo (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To start, heat up your pan and cook the ground beef until its completely brown, (this should be obvious, but stating it just in case)</li>
            <li>Once it's cooked, drain it and put it back in the pan. Pour a cup of water and mix in the taco seasoning. Mix and let it simmer until the water is evaporated, but the meat is still wet</li>
            <li>The meat is done and you're already ready to start assembling! Serve yourself however many chips you want and put some meat on it</li>
            <li>Then add the cheese, the sour cream and the extra toppings if you want as well. For the pickled jalapenos, I like pouring some of the vinegar onto my nachos for that extra kick. Highly recommended</li>
            <li>And enjoy! And since you didn't bake everything together, you don't have to worry about the chips being soggy if there's leftovers, let alone how to even store it in the fridge. Just reheat the meat and repeat the assembly!</li>
        </ol>
