        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy, 30 or so minute recipe for a truly cheesy, creamy buffalo chicken alfredo that still packs a kick.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Chicken (breast or thighs)</li>
            <li>A box of penne</li>
            <li>Buffalo sauce of your choice, (Frank's Red gives my wife heartburn, but others don't)</li>
            <li>Ranch (you don't need much)</li>
            <li>Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Heavy cream or milk, (heavy cream is better, but it is pricier)</li>
            <li>Mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice your chicken into small pieces, (up to preference, but I prefer them decently small since they cook faster and marinate better).</li>
            <li>Pour about a cup, (or more!), of buffalo sauce and about 1/4 cup of ranch into a container, then put a couple pinches of salt and pepper in it.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in the sauce mix and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, (or for a better taste, overnight).</li>
            <li>Once you're ready to start cooking, get your water going for the pasta since penne tends to take longer than most to boil. I recommend adding a good helping of salt to the water.</li>
            <li>Heat up your pan and toss in the chicken mix, (no need for oil since the mix is plenty oily as is). Let the chicken cook through, about 8 minutes or so. Feel free to cut one open to see if the chicken is white.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked through, toss in 4 to 8oz of cream cheese, (up tp you depending on how creamy you want it. I'm a glutton, so I toss in all 8oz, but we don't always have that much on hand).</li>
            <li>Let the cream cheese mostly melt before adding the heavy cream or milk, as this will cool down the dish considerably. Let it heat back up.</li>
            <li>And finally, add at least a cup of mozzerlla and let that melt through.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on some garnish of parsley or green onions, (maybe even some crushed red peppers if you want more kick), serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
